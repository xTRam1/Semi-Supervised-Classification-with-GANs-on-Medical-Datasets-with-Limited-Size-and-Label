# Semi-Supervised-Classification-with-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-on-Medical-Datasets
Reproducible Software Artifact for paper "Semi-Supervised Classification with Generative Adversarial Networks on Medical Datasets with Limited Size and Label" by ErdoÄŸan, 2020.

# Reproducing Results
1. Navigate to the experiment you want to reproduce (ResNet50 or SS-DiffAugment-GAN.)
2. Modify ``` train.sh ``` for the experiment you want to produce. (Refer to paper for hyperparameters.)
3. Write ``` bash train.sh ``` to the command line to train. 

# Testing
1. Navigate to the experiment you want to reproduce (ResNet50 or SS-DiffAugment-GAN.)
2. Modify ``` test.sh ``` for the log you want to perform inference. (After training automatically you must have a file called logs containing the model checkpoint.)
3. Write ``` bash test.sh ``` to the command line to test. 

Note: There is no need to download a dataset as it is already on the repo. However, you need to specify the path of the dataset images to ``` train.sh ``` and ``` test.sh ``` before training and testing respectively.
